bitdiff
=======

The standard UNIX tool to compare two files is 'diff' (see manual pages 'man diff' for further information). 
This tool reports the differences between two files. It can handle any type of files and does a really good job. 
This tool here does a similar job, but prints out in addition which bits differ from each other in two characters.
